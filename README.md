# 🍔 McDonald's Nutrition Analysis - Data Science Project

This project was developed as part of the **Introduction to Data Science** course. It explores the nutritional content of items on the McDonald's menu, applies machine learning to predict calorie content, and deploys an interactive web app using Streamlit.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **McDonald's Nutrition Facts** dataset contains detailed nutritional values of menu items including calories, fats, sugars, and more.

This project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine Learning model to predict `Calories`
- Interactive Streamlit app that allows users to input food characteristics and get calorie predictions
